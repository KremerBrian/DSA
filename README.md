Data Structures and Algorithms

Brian Kremer

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
      The problems being solved here were directly related to the data structures and algorithms. Specifically, project one focused            on the run time analysis and memory usage of various data structures including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and          graphs. Project two specifically focused on the sorting and printing of a list of courses in the Computer Science program in             alphanumeric order.
    
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
      Approaching the problems, I woould first understood the problem statement and requirements, then i'd determine the most                  appropriate data structure to use based on the specific characteristics of the problem. Understanding data structures is important        in solving problems because it allows for efficient and effective manipulation of data. I used various techniques such as                implementing algorithms and optimizing code for performance and memory usage.
      
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
      A roadblock I encountered while going through the activities was understanding the nuances of various data structures and their          implementation details. I overcame this by reviewing class notes, researching online resources, and seeking help from peers and          instructors. In Project Two, one roadblock was implementing the sorting algorithm correctly. I overcame this by breaking down the        problem into smaller parts, testing each part separately, and then integrating them into a working solution.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
      These projects and their work have expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by reinforcing the                 importance of understanding data structures and algorithms. It has also taught me to consider the trade offs between different           data structures and to choose the most appropriate one based on the specific requirements of the problem. In addition, it has            emphasized the importance of testing, optimization, and documentation in developing high quality software.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
      My work within these projects has evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by reinforcing         the importance of modular design, concise code, and commenting. It has also taught me to consider edge cases and error handling,         and to refactor code for readability and maintainability. The delving into multple data structures and algorithms opened my eyes         to why certain businesses opperate in their ways. Overall, working on these projects has been a valuable learning experience that        has improved my programming skills and approach.
